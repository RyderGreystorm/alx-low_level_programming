Welcome to my course on dynamic memory allocation. This course explores, malloc(), calloc(), realloc() and free() as functions in the stdlib.h that helps with dynakic memory allocation.

You will find files like the main.h file which is a header file containing all the libraries and functions I used for this particular project. The questions below are tasks that i solved. PLease contact me on +233556285072 or email me on biekrogodbless@gmail.com if you have any criticcs on the code or need clarification on anything. ENJOY

Question 0
I used the malloc() function in a self defined function called "char \*create_array(unsigned int size, char c)" which can be found in the 0-create_array.c file to allocate momory for the user to input any number of a specific char.
